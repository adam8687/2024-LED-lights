## LED Signal System for Robotics Communication
- This project showcases an LED signal system designed to improve communication during FRC matches. The system was developed to address the challenge of real-time coordination between human team members and robot drivers.

This LED signal system played a crucial role in improving communication and coordination in robotics competitions, especially during high-pressure moments requiring quick decision-making.


## Key Features:

- Visual Signaling: Integrated LED lights to provide clear, color-coded signals for various game states or robot commands.
- Team Collaboration: Enhanced teamwork by allowing human operators to quickly interpret and react to robot actions during matches.
- Hardware and Software Integration: Developed a system that seamlessly connects programmable LED strips with the robotics control interface.
- Impact: Improved strategic communication, contributing to the team's success at local and state competitions, and culminating in participation at the World Championship.
